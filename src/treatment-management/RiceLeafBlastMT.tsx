        <b>Step-by-Step Treatment</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 1: Confirm the plant disease.
        *refer to the plant disease information.*
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 2: If you spot a leaf with the signs and symptoms and rice that look deformed or
        discolored, carefully remove them with clean scissors. Try not to shake the plant while
        cutting the leaves affected by the disease, as it can shake down and spread the disease.
        Start from the base of the leaf and remove the whole leaf carefully.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 3: Dispose of the affected parts properly with a tightly sealed trash bag and clean the
        cutting tools.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 4: Find a new location to transfer the affected plant if the area it has is crowded with
        other plants. Transfer the affected plants with a shovel and give them enough space and air
        circulation in their surroundings so they won't affect other plants. Enough sunlight can kill the
        fungus affecting the plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 5: Remove any weeds in the plant area to prevent it from hosting disease-causing microorganisms.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 6: Create a protective barrier using mulch(organic materials such as dried tree bark, straws, and
        dried leaves). This will also ensure your crop does not grow weeds that can also host the fungus and
        other disease-causing microorganisms. Please note that you should use thoroughly dried leaves or organic
        materials as they may contain other disease-causing microorganisms, and make sure to make them thinner
        as much as possible.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        (Optional) After finishing the steps, you can use copper-based fungicides or standard fungicides that can help
        prevent fungus growth. (It is always better to consult with experts on which one to use)

        <b>Daily Monitoring: </b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        After finishing the step by step treatment, monitoring the disease-inflicted plant is a must.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Here's what you should do:
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        1. Remove any weeds near your plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        2. Check the ground for dryness, and if dry, water your plants starting from the base or bottom. Avoid
        splashing or watering the leaves. Just enough to make the land moist, not too much water.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        3. Always check out for signs and symptoms, as lingering fungus can affect the plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-4'>
        <b>Prevention:</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        To prevent this kind of disease in the future, here's what you can do:
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        1. Use rice varieties that are resistant to fungal and other diseases; this way, you won't worry much
        about the susceptibility to various plant diseases.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        2. Outsmart these plant diseases by crop rotation; avoid planting rice in the exact location yearly.
        Crop rotation disrupts the life cycles of these fungal diseases, making it hard for them to infect another plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        3. Make sure to leave enough space so that sunlight can reach the whole plant itself. Spacing can also help with air
        circulation to reduce humidity around the plants,
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        4. Remove any weeds to prevent any disease-causing microorganisms.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        5. Early detection of any signs of plant diseases is a must; monitor your plants to avoid spreading further. They usually
        have abnormalities in appearance besides the usual green color.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        6. Avoid using overhead irrigation such as sprinklers.

            Cultural strategies to manage this disease include useful techniques that rice producers are urged to follow. Crop rotation is one simple and
            effective technique that is highly recommended simply because it provides a mechanism that separates viable spores in crop residue from the newly
            emerging seedlings. A second technique that rice producers are urged to consider is to fertilize each of the different cultivars properly.
            Overuse of nitrogen fertilizers, as shown above, increases the amount of rice blast in their fields while often failing to significantly increase yields.
            A third technique that is often overlooked or difficult to employ in some fields is maintaining a proper flood level for the rice to grow. Rice blast is
            known to be more severe in fields or parts of fields in which the water in paddies falls below recommended levels. Thus, rice blast is often severe in
            fields that were not rotated, are under-irrigated, and are over-fertilized. Finally, using high quality and disease-free seed is always highly recommended
            because infested seeds left on the soil surface provide inoculum from which epidemics develop.
          </li>
          <li>
            Genetic resistance is a strategy that has long been the mainstay of successful rice production in the United States, even though the fungus has shown genetic
            variability for virulence. In the United States, many rice cultivars contain genes that confer resistance to one or more of the individual races of the fungus
            found regionally, and many also contain a high level of resistance to the fungus that is conferred by many other genes. The major difficulty in controlling
            rice blast with genetic resistance is that there are many races of the pathogen, and cultivars containing a single gene conferring resistance to a specific
            race of the pathogen often become susceptible over time with the development of new races that can infect plants with that specific resistance gene. For example,
            a mutation of an 'avirulence' gene in the blast fungus that produces an elicitor that induced the expression of resistance in the host with the Pi-ta gene for
            resistance has led to the formation of a new race capable of infecting plants that carry that important resistance gene, simply because the plant did not recognize
            the new race of the pathogen. In this way, the new race of the fungus has eluded resistance, which means that the cultivars containing this important resistance
            gene are very susceptible to the new race, even though they remain resistant to the other races of the fungus.
          </li>
          <li>
            A third strategy that has long been viewed as a last resort for rice blast is the use of chemical fungicides to control the disease. There are two basic techniques
            that can be used to manage diseases with the chemical fungicide strategy. The first technique uses seed treatments to prevent infection of the seedlings after germination.
            The second technique uses fungicides to prevent infection of leaves and panicles during the growing season by making one or two applications of fungicides to the foliage
            to protect the panicles when they are emerging from the boot. This technique attempts to reduce the incidence of rice blast on the panicle necks and panicles. Both
            techniques have been used to manage rice blast but neither one is considered to be highly successful. In addition, the use of foliar fungicides applied by airplanes can be
            very expensive.

            Managing rice blast requires vigilance and careful integration of many strategies and techniques learned in all parts of the world by the individual rice producer. A single mistake
            can result in crop failure from this one important plant disease.

      <div className='mt-2'>
        <b>Cultural Management</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Involve all practices from sowing to after harvesting. Burning of residues prevents over wintering of pathogen but it is not able to prevent source of inoculums.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-2'>
        <b>Nutrient Management</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Soil with high organic matter and biological activities shows better fertility status which prevents infection. So that, Nutrient management plays a significant role in Rice blast disease control. In Nutrient management, Nitrogen (N) and silicon (Si) elements affect disease incidence and development. Several studies have shown that heavy used of Nitrogen fertilizer increases susceptibility of rice plant to blast. So, Application of Nitrogen in Split doses reduced excessive vegetative growth during early season and reduced blast severity. Moreover, Researched on effect of Nitrogen fertilizer and it relation with blast diseases also supported the split-N treatment for susceptible cultivar. Mention that wetness of leaf increased neck blast rapidly.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Silicon is commonly known as "beneficial element" for plants. Research shows that Application of silicon to soil results in localized in leaf surface which act as a physical barrier against blast. Accumulation of more silica on the shoots of rice results in less incidence of blast. The experiment conducted in a green house, at the Universidadae Federal de Uberlandia, MG it was observed that greatest reduction of blast incidence at 4 g Si/L, regardless of solution pH. Moreover, Silicon application shows potential towards blast resistance but do not increases yield of rice. Silicon is expensive in application against blast which is economically non viable. So, locally available straws of rice genotypes have high silicon content which is best for farmer level application. So, Silicon is one of the best nutrient management for blast resistance. Similarly, Flooding of rice field creates anaerobic condition which eliminates diseases as water makes unfavorable condition to pathogen (Koutroubas and Ntanos, 2008). Water seedling reduced transmissions of disease from seed to seedling. Among cereals Rice is most susceptible and it has low ability to tolerate water loss results into rice blast attacks.

        <b>Chemical Management</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Farmers depend on chemical pesticides for management of blast. Experiment conducted by Jamal et. al concluded that Mancozeb is effective against blast at 1000 ppm and 10,000 ppm. A group researchers reported that foliar spray of Isoprothiolane at 1.5 ml/l decreased blast which was followed by carpropamid and carbendazim. With the application of isoprothiolane both grain and straw yield was increased as compared to other control. Chemical management practices are neither practical nor environmentally familiar. Experiment conducted by Magar et al in Chitwan, Nepal concluded that combination of Tricyclazole 22 % + Hexaconazole 3% SC in Thrice from booting stage at weekly interval showed highest disease control (87.03 % and 79.62 % in leaf and neck blast respectively) and highest grain yield(4.23t/ha). Earlier also revealed that Captan and Acrobat controlled rice blast.

      <div className='mt-2'>
        <b>Biological Management</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Earlier, Pseudomonas fluorescens strains were used as control of soil borne pathogens controlled foliar disease but powder formulation having long shelf life is more beneficial (Weller, 1988; Gnanamanickam and Mew, 1992). So, Later Studies on biocontrol of rice blast showed that powder formulation of Pseudomonas fluorescens strain Pf1 at 10g/kg inhibit the growth of rice blast.
