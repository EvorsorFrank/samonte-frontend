      <div className='mt-1'>
        Management of TYLCV is a multi-step strategy. Plants suspected of TYLCV infection should be rogued from the garden and destroyed in the following manner:
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1 text-start'>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-10">
          <li>
            Symptomatic plants should be carefully covered by a clear or black plastic bag and tied at the stem at soil line. Cut off the plant below the bag and allow bag with plant and whiteflies to desiccate to death on the soil surface for 1-2 days prior to placing the plant in the trash. Do not cut the plant off or pull it out of the garden and toss it on the compost! The goal is to remove the plant reservoir of virus from the garden and to trap the existing virus-bearing whiteflies so they do not disperse onto other tomatoes.
          </li>
          <li>
            If symptomatic plants have no obvious whiteflies on the lower leaf surface, these plants can be cut from the garden and BURIED in the compost.
          </li>
          <li>
            Although the silverlef whitefly feeds on more than 500 plants, some of its more favorite vegetable hosts other than tomatoes include the squash and cucumber family of plants, okra, beans, peanuts & eggplant. Favorite landscape plants include hibiscus, poinsettia, Gerbera daisy and many bedding plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inspect plants for whitefly infestations two times per week. If whiteflies are beginning to appear, spray with azadirachtin (Neem), pyrethrin or insecticidal soap. For more effective control, it is recommended that at least two of the above insecticides be rotated at each spraying. Follow label directions closely for dosage rates, spray intervals and precautions. Spray the undersides of the leaves thoroughly.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Since TYLCV is an obligate intracellular parasite, the plant disease caused by this virus is incurable in field conditions, and management of TYLCV is a major concern worldwide. Therefore, the success in management of TYLCV disease is dependent on good agricultural practices before, during, and after the growing season.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-2 font-semibold'>
        Before Planting:
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Before planting or transplanting, it is critical to use virus-free and insect-free transplants and, if possible, resistant varieties. Growing resistant varieties is ideal and eco-friendly to control TYLCV disease. Six quantitative trait loci, namely Ty-1/3, Ty-2, Ty-4, ty-5, and Ty-6, have been identified from wild tomato species.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        These resistance genes/loci have been introduced into commercially acceptable cultivars during the past decades via traditional breeding methods and have played vital roles in rendering plant resistant to TYLCV and several begomoviruses. However, they are ineffective against the entire suit of tomato-infecting begomoviruses, and resistance might be overcome by TYLCV-betasatellite disease complexes
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        After selecting the variety and source of planting material, it is important to determine the planting dates and field location. In general, when viral infection of plants occurs at their early developmental stages, the disease symptoms caused by TYLCV will be more severe, and the yield loss will be higher. If the population information of whitefly and virus pressure of TYLCV is available, new planting can be established when the population of whitefly and sources of TYLCV inoculum are at the lowest levels. When possible, protected culture and row covers can be used to exclude whiteflies, especially for high-value vegetable crops grown in greenhouses. Furthermore, growing plants with adequate nutrition and water is helpful in improving soil health, plant immunity, and yield.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-2 font-semibold'>
        During the growing season:
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        As the severity of the disease caused by TYLCV is correlated with the host, the titer of virus inoculum, and the population of whiteflies, it is vital to inspect
        the field frequently during the growing season. The population of whiteflies in protected cultures and the open field could be monitored using yellow sticky cards.
        At present, the application of insecticides is the most commonly used approach to control the population of insect vectors. However, one of the problems with using
        insecticides is the emergence of insect vector populations with insecticide resistance. This is well documented for
        the supervector B. tabaci in China. Thus, rotation of insecticides with different modes of action during a growing season is recommended
        to minimize the development of insecticide resistance in vector. An alternative approach for controlling insect vectors is to release biocontrol reagents such as
        predators, parasitoids, and fungi to reduce vector populations.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Roguing is a practice that involves the removal of TYLCV-infected plants during the growing season. This can reduce sources of virus inoculum and is most helpful in slowing down the spread of TYLCV if the incidence of the virus is low. To avoid releasing viruliferous whiteflies, rogued plants should be immediately sealed in whitefly-proof containers and destroyed.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-2 font-semibold'>
        After harvest:
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        After harvest, it is critical to destroy infected plants properly. To eliminate or reduce the initial inoculum sources in a defined region, extensive sanitation should also be carried out to eliminate or reduce the initial inoculum sources. As weeds often serve as reservoir hosts of TYLCV, removing weeds in and around fields is critical. Crop rotation with non-host of TYLCV or whitefly can be used to combat TYLCV and whitefly pressure. A host-free period is advised to reduce virus inoculum or vector populations when possible. Host-free periods have successfully managed TYLCV in the Dominican Republic.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        In short, integrated pest management (IPM) is a general and valuable strategy to reduce economic losses and epidemics caused by TYLCV below an acceptable threshold. Therefore, the above TYLCV management is mainly based on two principles: one is to prevent TYLCV from entering the plants by using resistant plant varieties or using virus-free planting materials, and the other is to use prophylaxis practices to restrain TYLCV spread by eliminating reservoirs, surveillance, and control of whiteflies.
