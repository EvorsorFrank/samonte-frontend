        <b>Step-by-Step Treatment</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 1: Confirm the plant disease.
        *refer to the plant disease information.*
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 2: If you spot a leaf with the signs and symptoms and tomato that look deformed or
        discolored, carefully remove them with clean scissors. Try not to shake the plant while
        cutting the leaves affected by the disease, as it can shake down and spread the disease.
        Start from the base of the leaf and remove the whole leaf carefully.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 3: Dispose of the affected parts properly with a tightly sealed trash bag and clean the
        cutting tools.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 4: Find a new location to transfer the affected plant if the area it has is crowded with
        other plants. Transfer the affected plants with a shovel and give them enough space and air
        circulation in their surroundings so they won't affect other plants. Enough sunlight can kill the
        fungus affecting the plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 5: Remove any weeds in the plant area to prevent it from hosting disease-causing microorganisms.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 6: Create a protective barrier using mulch(organic materials such as dried tree bark, straws, and
        dried leaves). This will also ensure your crop does not grow weeds that can also host the fungus and
        other disease-causing microorganisms. Please note that you should use thoroughly dried leaves or organic
        materials as they may contain other disease-causing microorganisms, and make sure to make them thinner
        as much as possible.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        (Optional) After finishing the steps, you can use antibiotics that can help
        kill bacteria (bactericide) or suppress bacteria growth(bacteriostatic). (It is always better to consult with experts on which one to use)

        <b>Daily Monitoring: </b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        After finishing the step by step treatment, monitoring the disease-inflicted plant is a must.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Here's what you should do:
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        1. Remove any weeds near your plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        2. Check the ground for dryness, and if dry, water your plants starting from the base or bottom. Avoid
        splashing or watering the leaves and avoid overhead irrigation that sprinkles the leaves. Just enough to make the land moist, not too much water.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        3. Always check out for signs and symptoms, as lingering fungus can affect the plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-4'>
        <b>Prevention:</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        To prevent this kind of disease in the future, here's what you can do:
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        1. Use tomato varieties that are resistant to bacterial and other diseases; this way, you won't worry much
        about the susceptibility to various plant diseases.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        2. Outsmart these plant diseases by crop rotation; avoid planting tomato in the exact location yearly.
        Crop rotation disrupts the life cycles of these fungal diseases, making it hard for them to infect another plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        3. Make sure to leave enough space so that sunlight can reach the whole plant itself. Spacing can also help with air
        circulation to reduce humidity around the plants,
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        4. Remove any weeds to prevent any disease-causing microorganisms.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        4. Avoid using overhead irrigation such as sprinklers.

        Crop Rotation
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Rotate fields out of tomato and pepper for twelve months before planting either crop again. This “rest” period allows crop debris that carries bacteria to decay, which kills the pathogen.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-2 font-semibold'>
        Cleanup (Sanitation)
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1 text-start'>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-10">
          <li>
            Promptly destroy crops after the last harvest to stop bacteria from multiplying in and on plants left in abandoned fields.
          </li>
          <li>
            Destroy spring crops before transplanting a fall crop on the same farm, so bacteria do not spread from one crop to the next.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not replant into plastic or organic mulch used for a previous crop. Enough crop debris is left on or in the mulch to carry over the bacteria from crop to crop.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-2 font-semibold'>
        Row and Plant Spacing
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        The longer the leaves are wet, the greater the risk of bacterial spot. Leaves dry faster after dew or rain when there is more space between rows and extra space between plants in rows. This helps reduce the severity of bacterial spot.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1 text-start'>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-10">
          <li>
            Space rows eight to twelve feet apart for tomato and eight feet apart for pepper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Leave a minimum of twenty-four inches between tomato plants and eighteen inches between pepper plants. Increasing the spacing between plants by six inches, if economical, is better.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-2 font-semibold'>
        Handling Plants
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        As most growers know, it is easy to spread bacteria when workers handle wet plants. Sucker, stake, tie, and harvest plants only when they have dried after dew or rain.
      </div>

        Chemical Control
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1 text-start'>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-10">
          <li>
            Begin spray applications two weeks after transplanting in the spring and one week after transplanting in the fall.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spray on a weekly schedule.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use copper at the highest labeled rate. Do not mix copper with Actigard® due to phytotoxicity of the mixture.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        On fruiting vegetables, Actigard® has a 14-day Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI), Mancozeb® has a 7-day PHI, and Tanos® has a 3-day PHI. To make scheduling harvests easier, use Tanos® + copper weekly after harvesting starts.
