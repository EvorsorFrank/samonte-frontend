        <b>Step-by-Step Treatment</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 1: Confirm the plant disease.
        *refer to the plant disease information.*
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 2: If you spot a leaf with the signs and symptoms and tomato that look deformed or
        discolored, carefully remove them with clean scissors. Try not to shake the plant while
        cutting the leaves affected by the disease, as it can shake down and spread the disease.
        Start from the base of the leaf and remove the whole leaf carefully.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 3: Dispose of the affected parts properly with a tightly sealed trash bag and clean the
        cutting tools.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 4: Find a new location to transfer the affected plant if the area it has is crowded with
        other plants. Transfer the affected plants with a shovel and give them enough space and air
        circulation in their surroundings so they won't affect other plants. Enough sunlight can kill the
        fungus affecting the plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 5: Remove any weeds in the plant area to prevent it from hosting disease-causing microorganisms.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 6: Create a protective barrier using mulch(organic materials such as dried tree bark, straws, and
        dried leaves). This will also ensure your crop does not grow weeds that can also host the fungus and
        other disease-causing microorganisms. Please note that you should use thoroughly dried leaves or organic
        materials as they may contain other disease-causing microorganisms, and make sure to make them thinner
        as much as possible.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        (Optional) After finishing the steps, you can use copper-based fungicides or standard fungicides that can help
        prevent fungus growth. (It is always better to consult with experts on which one to use)

        <b>Daily Monitoring: </b>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        After finishing the step by step treatment, monitoring the disease-inflicted plant is a must.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Here's what you should do:
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        1. Remove any weeds near your plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        2. Check the ground for dryness, and if dry, water your plants starting from the base or bottom. Avoid
        splashing or watering the leaves. Just enough to make the land moist, not too much water.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        3. Always check out for signs and symptoms, as lingering fungus can affect the plant.

        <b>Prevention:</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        To prevent this kind of disease in the future, here's what you can do:
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        1. Use tomato varieties that are resistant to fungal and other diseases; this way, you won't worry much
        about the susceptibility to various plant diseases.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        2. Outsmart these plant diseases by crop rotation; avoid planting tomato in the exact location yearly.
        Crop rotation disrupts the life cycles of these fungal diseases, making it hard for them to infect another plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        3. Make sure to leave enough space so that sunlight can reach the whole plant itself. Spacing can also help with air
        circulation to reduce humidity around the plants,

      <div className='mt-1'>
        4. Remove any weeds to prevent any disease-causing microorganisms.

        Target spot tomato treatment requires a multi-pronged approach. The following tips for treating target spot on tomatoes should help:
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1 text-start'>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-10">
          <li>
            Remove old plant debris at the end of the growing season; otherwise, the spores will travel from debris to newly planted tomatoes in the following growing season, thus beginning the disease anew. Dispose of the debris properly and don’t place it on your compost pile unless you’re sure your compost gets hot enough to kill the spores.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rotate crops and don't plant tomatoes in areas where other disease-prone plants have been located in the past year– primarily eggplant, peppers, potatoes or, of course – tomatoes. Rutgers University Extension recommends a three-year rotation cycle to reduce soil-borne fungi.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pay careful attention to air circulation, as target spot of tomato thrives in humid conditions. Grow the plants in full sunlight. Be sure the plants aren’t crowded and that each tomato has plenty of air circulation. Cage or stake tomato plants to keep the plants above the soil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Water tomato plants in the morning so the leaves have time to dry. Water at the base of the plant or use a soaker hose or drip system to keep the leaves dry. Apply a mulch to keep the fruit from coming in direct contact with the soil. Limit mulch to 3 inches (8 cm.) or less if your plants are bothered by slugs or snails.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        You can also apply fungal spray as a preventive measure early in the season or as soon as the disease is noticed.

        Cultural practices for target spot management include improving airflow through the canopy by wider plant spacing and avoiding over-fertilizing with nitrogen, which can cause overly lush canopy formation. Pruning suckers and older leaves in the lower canopy can also increase airflow and reduce leaf wetness.1,5,9 Avoid planting tomatoes near old plantings. Inspect seedlings for target spot symptoms before transplanting. Manage weeds, which may serve as alternate hosts, and avoid the use of overhead irrigation. Destroy crop residues shortly after the final harvest, and rotate away from tomato and other known hosts for at least three years. Resistance to target spot is not available in commercial tomato varieties, although partial resistance has been observed in wild species of tomato.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        The primary strategy used to manage target spot on tomato is the regular application of fungicides. Applications should begin before symptoms appear when conditions are favorable for infection and disease development. Fungicides may need to be applied at regular intervals (every 10 to 14 days is common) depending on the label directions of the products used. Full coverage of all plant surfaces is needed for the best control of target spot.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Many fungicides are registered to control of target spot on tomatoes. Growers should consult regional disease management guides for recommended products.10 Products containing chlorothalonil, mancozeb, and copper oxychloride have been shown to provide good control of target spot in research trials.1,9 The strobilurin fungicides azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin, the fungicide boscalid, and the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) elicitor acibenzolar-S-methyl have also been shown to provide good control of target spot.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        The labels of many of the fungicides registered for target spot control indicate that the products should be tank-mixed or alternated with fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the target spot pathogen. This is especially important when using strobilurin fungicides because they are at high risk for resistance development. Strains of C. cassiicola that are resistant to strobilurin fungicides have been detected in tomato and other crops.2,4,8 Successful, long-term management of target spot on tomato will require the use of integrated programs that include cultural and chemical management strategies.
