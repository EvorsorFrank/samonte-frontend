          The Mosaic Virus (ToMV) is a highly contagious viral disease that affects tomato plants, causing distinctive mosaic-like patterns of light and dark green on the leaves.
          The virus is primarily transmitted through contaminated seeds, infected plant debris, and mechanical transmission via tools and hands during cultivation.
          Infected plants may exhibit stunted growth, leaf distortion, and reduced fruit quality and yield.
          ToMV can persist in weed hosts and alternative host plants, serving as reservoirs for the virus and contributing to its spread.
          Optimal temperatures for ToMV replication and spread typically range from 20 to 30Â°C.
          Although the virus does not typically kill tomato plants outright, it can severely reduce marketable yields and render fruits unmarketable due to discoloration and deformities.
