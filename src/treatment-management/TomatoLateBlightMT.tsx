        <b>Step-by-Step Treatment</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 1: Confirm the plant disease.
        *refer to the plant disease information.*
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 2: If you spot a leaf with the signs and symptoms and tomato that look deformed or
        discolored, carefully remove them with clean scissors. Try not to shake the plant while
        cutting the leaves affected by the disease, as it can shake down and spread the disease.
        Start from the base of the leaf and remove the whole leaf carefully.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 3: Dispose of the affected parts properly with a tightly sealed trash bag and clean the
        cutting tools.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 4: Find a new location to transfer the affected plant if the area it has is crowded with
        other plants. Transfer the affected plants with a shovel and give them enough space and air
        circulation in their surroundings so they won't affect other plants. Enough sunlight can kill the
        fungus affecting the plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 5: Remove any weeds in the plant area to prevent it from hosting disease-causing microorganisms.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 6: Create a protective barrier using mulch(organic materials such as dried tree bark, straws, and
        dried leaves). This will also ensure your crop does not grow weeds that can also host the fungus and
        other disease-causing microorganisms. Please note that you should use thoroughly dried leaves or organic
        materials as they may contain other disease-causing microorganisms, and make sure to make them thinner
        as much as possible.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        (Optional) After finishing the steps, you can use copper-based fungicides or standard fungicides that can help
        prevent fungus growth. (It is always better to consult with experts on which one to use)

        <b>Daily Monitoring: </b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        After finishing the step by step treatment, monitoring the disease-inflicted plant is a must.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Here's what you should do:
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        1. Remove any weeds near your plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        2. Check the ground for dryness, and if dry, water your plants starting from the base or bottom. Avoid
        splashing or watering the leaves. Just enough to make the land moist, not too much water.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        3. Always check out for signs and symptoms, as lingering fungus can affect the plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-4'>
        <b>Prevention:</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        To prevent this kind of disease in the future, here's what you can do:
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        1. Use tomato varieties that are resistant to fungal and other diseases; this way, you won't worry much
        about the susceptibility to various plant diseases.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        2. Outsmart these plant diseases by crop rotation; avoid planting tomato in the exact location yearly.
        Crop rotation disrupts the life cycles of these fungal diseases, making it hard for them to infect another plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        3. Make sure to leave enough space so that sunlight can reach the whole plant itself. Spacing can also help with air
        circulation to reduce humidity around the plants,
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        4. Remove any weeds to prevent any disease-causing microorganisms.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        5. Avoid using overhead irrigation such as sprinklers.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        6. Early detection of any signs of plant diseases is a must; monitor your plants to avoid spreading further. They usually
        have abnormalities in appearance besides the usual green color.

      <div className='mt-2'>
        <b>Option 1</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Before disease occurs, apply fungicides at 7-10-day intervals. After disease is detected in your area, apply fungicides at 5-7-day intervals. Alternate products and tank mix with chlorothalonil to avoid generating fungicide-resistant strains. For the latest fungicide recommendations for tomato late blight see the Southeastern US Vegetable Crop Handbook. Fungicide labels are legal documents, always read and follow fungicide labels.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Products containing the active ingredients copper or chlorothalonil (the trade name of one product with chlorothalonil is known as ‘Daconil') are the best and only effective products available to home gardeners. In addition, home gardeners should grow varieties with resistance if they are worried about late blight in future years because most chemicals available to the home gardener are not sufficient to control late blight once it appears. Once plants are infected in a home garden, there is little that can be done to protect them besides weekly fungicide sprays.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Home owners should plant susceptible varieties early in the season or select a late blight resistant variety.

        <ul className="list-decimal ml-10">
          <li>
            Buy locally grown transplants or start your own at home.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select late blight-resistant varieties if late blight is a concern in your area.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep foliage dry; avoid overhead watering; avoid crowding your plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            Learn to distinguish the symptoms of late blight from those of other common tomato diseases, like early blight and Septoria leaf spot.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pull out and remove plants with late blight symptoms. This will protect your neighbors' gardens and local farmers. Put plants in a large plastic bag, seal the bag and leave it out in the sunshine for a week before putting it out with the household trash for pick-up. Do not attempt to compost infected plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            You cannot “cure” this disease once you see the symptoms. Protectant fungicides, like chlorothalonil, mancozeb, and fixed liquid copper, can help protect foliage if applied prior to infection. Copper sprays are acceptable for organic gardening.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove weeds in the tomato/potato family (e.g. horsenettle, Eastern black nightshade, jimsonweed) that can also serve as host plants.
