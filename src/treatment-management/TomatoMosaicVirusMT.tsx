            For several tomato viruses, there are cultivars that are resistant.
          </li>
          <li>
            Seek out disease-resistant seed varieties marked with catalog codes and abbreviations like ToMV and TMV. The resistant tomato varieties can be found here: https://www.vegetables.cornell.edu/pest-management/disease-factsheets/disease-resistant-vegetable-varieties/disease-resistant-tomato-varieties/

            If you have any plants in your garden that you suspect may be infected, remove them immediately to prevent the spread of the virus. Don't throw them in the compost. Infected plants should be uprooted entirely and burned.
          </li>
          <li>
            Always go through reliable retailers while purchasing transplants.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure to inspect transplants before buying them. Be sure there are no obvious symptoms before selecting a transplant.
          </li>
          <li>
            Infected plants often exhibit no visible signs of illness, therefore it's important to frequently disinfect tools, ideally between each plant.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are currently no effective chemical solutions against any other virus. The control of aphids and thrips during the production of transplants can aid in preventing the spread of plant viruses.
