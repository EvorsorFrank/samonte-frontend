        <b>Step-by-Step Treatment</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 1: Confirm the plant disease.
        *refer to the plant disease information.*
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 2: If you spot a leaf with the signs and symptoms and rice that look deformed or
        discolored, carefully remove them with clean scissors. Try not to shake the plant while
        cutting the leaves affected by the disease, as it can shake down and spread the disease.
        Start from the base of the leaf and remove the whole leaf carefully.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 3: Dispose of the affected parts properly with a tightly sealed trash bag and clean the
        cutting tools.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 4: Find a new location to transfer the affected plant if the area it has is crowded with
        other plants. Transfer the affected plants with a shovel and give them enough space and air
        circulation in their surroundings so they won't affect other plants. Enough sunlight can kill the
        fungus affecting the plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 5: Remove any weeds in the plant area to prevent it from hosting disease-causing microorganisms.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 6: Create a protective barrier using mulch(organic materials such as dried tree bark, straws, and
        dried leaves). This will also ensure your crop does not grow weeds that can also host the fungus and
        other disease-causing microorganisms. Please note that you should use thoroughly dried leaves or organic
        materials as they may contain other disease-causing microorganisms, and make sure to make them thinner
        as much as possible.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        (Optional) After finishing the steps, you can use copper-based fungicides or standard fungicides that can help
        prevent fungus growth. (It is always better to consult with experts on which one to use)

        <b>Daily Monitoring: </b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        After finishing the step by step treatment, monitoring the disease-inflicted plant is a must.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Here's what you should do:
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        1. Remove any weeds near your plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        2. Check the ground for dryness, and if dry, water your plants starting from the base or bottom. Avoid
        splashing or watering the leaves. Just enough to make the land moist, not too much water.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        3. Always check out for signs and symptoms, as lingering fungus can affect the plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-4'>
        <b>Prevention:</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        To prevent this kind of disease in the future, here's what you can do:
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        1. Use rice varieties that are resistant to fungal and other diseases; this way, you won't worry much
        about the susceptibility to various plant diseases.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        2. Outsmart these plant diseases by crop rotation; avoid planting rice in the exact location yearly.
        Crop rotation disrupts the life cycles of these fungal diseases, making it hard for them to infect another plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        3. Make sure to leave enough space so that sunlight can reach the whole plant itself. Spacing can also help with air
        circulation to reduce humidity around the plants,
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        4. Remove any weeds to prevent any disease-causing microorganisms.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        5. Early detection of any signs of plant diseases is a must; monitor your plants to avoid spreading further. They usually
        have abnormalities in appearance besides the usual green color.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        6. Avoid using overhead irrigation such as sprinklers.

      <div className='mt-1'>
        The disease develops largely in areas with high humidity and on crops planted in nutrient deficient soil. This infection occurs when leaves remain wet for 8 to 24 hours. It most often happens when the crop is planted from infected seeds or on volunteer crops, and when weeds or debris from previous crops is present.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1 text-start'>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-10">
          <li>
            Practice good sanitation in your fields to help avoid brown leaf spot of rice and plant disease-resistant varieties.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may also fertilize the crop, although this can take several growing seasons to work completely.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take a soil test to learn exactly which nutrients are missing in the field. Incorporate them into the soil and monitor them regularly.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can soak seeds before planting to limit the fungal disease.
          </li>
          <li>
            Soak in hot water 10 to 12 minutes or in cold water for eight hours overnight.
          </li>
          <li>
            Treat seeds with a fungicide if you're having problems with rice with brown leaf spots.
          </li>
        </ul>

        Now that you've learned what is rice brown leaf spot and how to properly treat the disease, you may increase the production and the quality of your crop.

          </li>
          <li>
            Since the fungus is seed transmitted, a hot water seed treatment (53-54Â°C) for 10-12 minutes may be effective before sowing. This treatment controls primary infection at the seedling stage. Presoaking the seed in cold water for 8 hours increases effectivity of the treatment.
