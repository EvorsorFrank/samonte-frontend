          Signs and Symptoms

        <div className="">
          The Leaf Mold is a fungal disease characterized by the appearance of pale green to yellowish patches on the upper surface of tomato leaves, accompanied by a fuzzy, white to grayish growth on the underside.
          Leaf Mold thrives in warm, humid environments, particularly when temperatures range from 20 to 24Â°C and relative humidity exceeds 85%.
          Unlike many other tomato diseases, Leaf Mold is less dependent on free water for spore germination and infection, making it more prevalent in greenhouse and high-tunnel production systems.
          Spores of the fungus can be dispersed through air currents, plant contact, and contaminated equipment.
          Severe infections can result in defoliation, reduced photosynthetic capacity, and fruit sunscald due to increased exposure.
