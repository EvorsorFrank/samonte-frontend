        <b>Step-by-Step Treatment</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 1: Confirm the plant disease.
        *refer to the plant disease information.*
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 2: If you spot a leaf with the signs and symptoms and rice that look deformed or
        discolored, carefully remove them with clean scissors. Try not to shake the plant while
        cutting the leaves affected by the disease, as it can shake down and spread the disease.
        Start from the base of the leaf and remove the whole leaf carefully.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 3: Dispose of the affected parts properly with a tightly sealed trash bag and clean the
        cutting tools.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 4: Find a new location to transfer the affected plant if the area it has is crowded with
        other plants. Transfer the affected plants with a shovel and give them enough space and air
        circulation in their surroundings so they won't affect other plants. Enough sunlight can kill the
        fungus affecting the plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 5: Remove any weeds in the plant area to prevent it from hosting disease-causing microorganisms.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 6: Create a protective barrier using mulch(organic materials such as dried tree bark, straws, and
        dried leaves). This will also ensure your crop does not grow weeds that can also host the fungus and
        other disease-causing microorganisms. Please note that you should use thoroughly dried leaves or organic
        materials as they may contain other disease-causing microorganisms, and make sure to make them thinner
        as much as possible.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        (Optional) After finishing the steps, you can use antibiotics that can help
        kill bacteria (bactericide) or suppress bacteria growth(bacteriostatic). (It is always better to consult with experts on which one to use)

        <b>Daily Monitoring: </b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        After finishing the step by step treatment, monitoring the disease-inflicted plant is a must.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Here's what you should do:
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        1. Remove any weeds near your plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        2. Check the ground for dryness, and if dry, water your plants starting from the base or bottom. Avoid
        splashing or watering the leaves and avoid overhead irrigation that sprinkles the leaves. Just enough to make the land moist, not too much water.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        3. Always check out for signs and symptoms, as lingering fungus can affect the plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-4'>
        <b>Prevention:</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        To prevent this kind of disease in the future, here's what you can do:
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        1. Use rice varieties that are resistant to bacterial and other diseases; this way, you won't worry much
        about the susceptibility to various plant diseases.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        2. Outsmart these plant diseases by crop rotation; avoid planting rice in the exact location yearly.
        Crop rotation disrupts the life cycles of these fungal diseases, making it hard for them to infect another plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        3. Make sure to leave enough space so that sunlight can reach the whole plant itself. Spacing can also help with air
        circulation to reduce humidity around the plants,
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        4. Remove any weeds to prevent any disease-causing microorganisms.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        5. Avoid using overhead irrigation such as sprinklers.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        6. Early detection of any signs of plant diseases is a must; monitor your plants to avoid spreading further. They usually
        have abnormalities in appearance besides the usual green color.

      <div className='mt-2'>
        <b>Biosecurity</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        National biosecurity organizations need to ensure that rice seed entering the country originates from crops certified free of bacterial leaf blight and is subject to closed quarantine upon arrival, and further testing for the bacterium causing this disease. Note there are different strains in different parts of the world.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-2'>
        <b>Cultural Control</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        In low-input farming systems, where resource-limited farmers can hardly ever afford external inputs, control of bacterial leaf blight is mainly through the use of resistant/tolerant varieties in combination with sound management practices, such as good weed control.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-2 font-bold'>
        Before planting:
      </div>

      <ul className="list-disc ml-10">
        <li>
          Take care when selecting seed. For farmers who are using their own seed, it is important that they always select from plants uninfected by bacterial leaf blight symptoms.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div className='mt-2 font-bold'>
        During Growth:
      </div>

      <ul className="list-disc ml-10">
        <li>
          Do not damage seedlings when taking them from the nursery. They should not be pulled from the soil but eased out with roots intact; the leaves should not be clipped.
        </li>

        <li>
          Be careful with fertilizer applications: too much nitrogen increases shoot and leaf production and creates conditions that promotes disease development because of higher humidity. A suggested amount is 80-100 kg N/ha, depending on local conditions.
        </li>

        <li>
          Ensure good drainage of fields (and nurseries). Most varieties are not able to withstand flooding for more than a week, and floodwater spreads the bacterial leaf blight between plants.
        </li>

        <li>
          Keep field clean of weeds, especially species of Leersia which are considered to be the main weed host of bacterial leaf blight.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div className='mt-2 font-bold'>
        After harvest:
      </div>

      <ul className="list-disc ml-10">
        <li>
          Plough land to bury rice stubble, straw, ratoon plants and volunteer seedlings. Note that the bacteria causing this disease do not live long in the soil.
        </li>

        <li>
          Allow fallow fields to dry to destroy the bacterium in the soil and in plant remains.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div className='mt-2'>
        <b>Resistant Varieties</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Resistant varieties are available in Southeast Asia: PSB Rc82 is a standard variety with resistance; Macassane, has been shown to have improved bacterial leaf blight resistance and is being used in Mozambique, and two IRRI varieties, IR22 and IR 54, are resistant and moderately resistant, respectively, in Tanzania. Several NERICA hybrids from Africa Rice have been tested and found to have resistance. Check whether these are available locally.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-2'>
        <b>Chemical Control</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Chemical treatments, such as applications of copper compounds or antibiotics, are costly and have NOT been shown to be effective.
      </div>
