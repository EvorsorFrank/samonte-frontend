        <b>Step-by-Step Treatment</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 1: Confirm the plant disease.
        *refer to the plant disease information.*
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 2: If you spot a leaf with the signs and symptoms and tomato that look deformed or
        discolored, carefully remove them with clean scissors. Try not to shake the plant while
        cutting the leaves affected by the disease, as it can shake down and spread the disease.
        Start from the base of the leaf and remove the whole leaf carefully.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 3: Dispose of the affected parts properly with a tightly sealed trash bag and clean the
        cutting tools.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 4: Find a new location to transfer the affected plant if the area it has is crowded with
        other plants. Transfer the affected plants with a shovel and give them enough space and air
        circulation in their surroundings so they won't affect other plants. Enough sunlight can kill the
        fungus affecting the plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 5: Remove any weeds in the plant area to prevent it from hosting disease-causing microorganisms.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Step 6: Create a protective barrier using mulch(organic materials such as dried tree bark, straws, and
        dried leaves). This will also ensure your crop does not grow weeds that can also host the fungus and
        other disease-causing microorganisms. Please note that you should use thoroughly dried leaves or organic
        materials as they may contain other disease-causing microorganisms, and make sure to make them thinner
        as much as possible.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        (Optional) After finishing the steps, you can use copper-based fungicides or standard fungicides that can help
        prevent fungus growth. (It is always better to consult with experts on which one to use)

        <b> Daily Monitoring: </b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        After finishing the step by step treatment, monitoring the disease-inflicted plant is a must.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Here's what you should do:
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        1. Remove any weeds near your plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        2. Check the ground for dryness, and if dry, water your plants starting from the base or bottom. Avoid
        splashing or watering the leaves. Just enough to make the land moist, not too much water.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        3. Always check out for signs and symptoms, as lingering fungus can affect the plant.
      </div>

        <b>Prevention:</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        To prevent this kind of disease in the future, here's what you can do:
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        1. Use tomato varieties that are resistant to fungal and other diseases; this way, you won't worry much
        about the susceptibility to various plant diseases.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        2. Outsmart these plant diseases by crop rotation; avoid planting tomato in the exact location yearly.
        Crop rotation disrupts the life cycles of these fungal diseases, making it hard for them to infect another plant.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        3. Make sure to leave enough space so that sunlight can reach the whole plant itself. Spacing can also help with air
        circulation to reduce humidity around the plants,
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        4. Remove any weeds to prevent any disease-causing microorganisms.

      <div className='mt-2'>
        <b>Option 1</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Once blight is positively identified, act quickly to prevent it from spreading. Remove all affected leaves and burn them or place them in the garbage. Mulch around the base of the plant with straw, wood chips or other natural mulch to prevent fungal spores in the soil from splashing on the plant. If blight has already spread to more than just a few plant leaves, apply DaconilÂ® Fungicide Ready-To-Use, which kills fungal spores and keeps blight from causing further damage.

        <b>Option 2</b>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        When planting tomatoes, plan to prevent blight. Incorporate these simple steps to keep your plants healthy.
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1 text-start'>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-10">
          <li>
            Practice crop rotation by planting tomatoes in a section of the garden that has not been used to grow tomatoes or any other member of the Solanaceae family, such as eggplant, potatoes or peppers, in the last two years
          </li>
          <li>
            Read seed packages or plant labels carefully to select a tomato variety that is resistant to blight
          </li>
          <li>
            Stake or cage tomato plants so that foliage grows vertically, off the ground.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mulch well around plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            When watering, use a soaker hose rather than an overhead sprinkler. This will reduce the amount of water on leaves and keep spores in the soil from splashing on plants.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div className='mt-1'>
        Inspect the plants in your garden every few days for signs of damage. Fast diagnosis and a quick response are the keys to a healthy, tasty harvest.
